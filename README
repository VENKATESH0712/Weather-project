This is my first project
It is used to know weather related information of various regions.
Using openweathermap API we can obtain weather information,
create account in openweathermap and you can see your
API key and URL information (it may take while to activate your API request, typically in minutes).
After getting them successfully fill in the provided fields (inside the Script tag).
