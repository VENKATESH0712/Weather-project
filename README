This is my first project
It is used to know weather related information of various regions.
Using openweathermap API we can obtain weather information,
create account in openweathermap and you can see your
API key and URL information (it may take while to activate your API request, typically in minutes).
After getting them successfully fill in the provided fields (inside the Script tag). 
    const apiKey = "add your API key here";
    const apiUrl = "Add your URL here";
after successfully adding them you can able to check the functionality of this weather app.
